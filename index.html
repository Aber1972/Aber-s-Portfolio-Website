          I am a creator of worlds — where motion meets meaning, color finds
          voice, and poetry breathes in pixels. As a graphic designer, motion
          artist, developer, writer, and English instructor, I don’t just build
          things. I tell stories. I shape emotion. This is not a portfolio. This
          is a reflection of me.

        <p class="explore-paragraph">
          Beyond the lines of code, beneath the strokes of ink, within every
          flicker of light and shadow — there is a universe I've built with
          heart. A world where words dance, colors breathe, and silence speaks.
          If you're ready to feel, not just see — if you dare to wander deeper —
          then I invite you to explore not just my portfolio, but my world.

        <p>
          I am a 22-year-old Afghan woman living in the beautiful city of Herat.
          I was raised in a knowledge-loving family where books, creativity, and
          dialogue were always valued. Since childhood, I’ve had a deep passion
          for both <strong>visual storytelling</strong> and
          <strong>language education</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a second-year student in the Graphic Design department
          at Herat University. I graduated from CTI’s Motion & Graphic Design
          program (2020–2024), where I honed my skills in creative expression,
          branding, and motion graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past three years, I’ve proudly worked as a volunteer and
          collaborator with World Vision. I’ve also participated in various
          seminars and programs, including the
          <em>Promote Women’s Leadership Development</em> initiative.
